         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

committed with all, the whole care of
Egypt to his proper and onely directions. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
alſo hee did not negligently behaue him ſelfe,
but ſo indifferentlie diſpoſed the bleſſinges and
treaſures of Egypt, as not onelie the great famin
fore-ſhewed, was (by his meanes) verie timelie
preuented: but an habitation alſo for his parents
and kinſefolkes (by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> conſent) very fitlie
prouided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11342:3"/>
Surelie (deare brethren) ſo oft as I remember
this ſtorie, I am driuen with all to conſider my
proper eſtate in this newly attempted enterpriſe;
For this poore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of mine (but newlie crept
from the ſwaddling clothes) was (at the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
foorth) ſo vnnaturallie hated of his elder
breethren (thoſe chapmen I meane before whom
he vttered his viſion) that (by the importunate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie
of ſome) he was faine to bee deliuered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vnto the <hi>Ishmeelitish merchants</hi> (to the Printers
I meane) or euer he had attained to anie full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of knowledge; which men alſo (reſpecting
chieflie their priuate profits) haue ſolde him ouer
againe vnto <hi>Potiphar</hi> king <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Stewarde, I
meane to you Merchaunts, and other her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
ſubiects. If therefore your good worſhips, or
anie els whoſoeuer (hauing him now at home in
your houſes) ſhall finde that the Lorde (by his
meanes) doth proſper your labors: refuſe not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(I beſeech you) forthwith to referre thoſe other
your domeſticall dealings to his approoued and
faithfull directions. And although that <hi>Potiphars</hi>
wife (I meane your worldlie wiſedomes) haled
an end with the ſwaie of her vnbridled affections,
ſhall happlie attempt (by the ſundrie ſuggeſtions
of Satan) to adulterate the yonglings former ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,
and not preuailing therein) ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thunder out her forged accuſations vniuſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: yet, let the godlie <hi>Potiphars</hi> in anie
wiſe beware that they ſhewe not them ſelues to
credulous in admitting thoſe cankred clamours,
neither yet ouer haſty in clapping him cloſe with
in the gaile of forgetfulnes, leaſt with all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
them ſelues of thoſe manifolde bleſſinges
which before by his meanes they embraced. For
<pb facs="tcp:11342:4"/>
notwithſtanding this their vnſpeakable crueltie
(concerning onely this poore of-ſpring of mine)
ſhould worke the aforeſaid effect: yet, I doubt not
at all, but that the Lord (who tendreth the truth
of his former integrity) will cauſe him by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
(I meane, by our gratious <hi>Princes</hi> procurement)
to haue a fuller enlargment, &amp; to come abroad
with more credit then at anie time heertofore.
Yea, and (waying withall his faithfull ſimplicitie)
will verie ſolempnelie decree and moſt ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
command, that your interchangable trafique
what-ſoeuer ſhall bee generallie diſpoſed by his
godly directions. The which ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to paſſe, I
dare boldly aſſure you, that not only the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
famin ſhall be for-ſtalled in time: but old <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acob</hi>
likewiſe with the reſt of his familie (I meane
the pore members of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> ſhall much better be
prouided for, then heretofore they haue beene.
Labor you therfore (my brethren) with <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
cheefe <hi>Butler</hi> when occaſion ſhall ſerue, and do
your dailie endeuours, (euerie one as his calling
requires) to make my poore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his cauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> court. I meane, do mooue
(as you maye) her moſt excellent maieſtie with
her honourable councellers, to ſee ſome more
faithfull execution of the eſtabliſhed lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the horrible abuſes in buyeng and ſelling:
for the better auoiding of all thoſe fearefull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which are handled hereafter at large in this
treatiſe. And whereas, that miſerable enhanſing
of graine and of victuales, and that chargeable
preperation of houſhould prouiſion which now
a-daies falleth out, may draw your mindes from
a due conſideration of your duties heerein and
hinder this woorke: I promiſe you therefore
<pb facs="tcp:11342:4"/>
ſoone as the Lord ſhall ennable me to it) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
in like manner with thoſe kinde of people
(who are to fraught the <hi>Markets</hi> for the aforeſaid
prouiſion) as I haue doone heare with your
ſelues, for the ſpeedier effecting of thoſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
            <p>Nowe next, concerning the treatiſe enſuing, I
meane to bee ſilent my ſelfe. Onelye, I haue
ſpoken therein: let the other prophets there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
determine as the Lorde ſhall direct them.
And, whereas it hath beene a vſuall practiſe
(drawen from the ſcriptures them ſelues and the
primitiue church) to dedicate euerie treatiſe to
ſome one man or other, and that for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
I thought it alſo a thing verie conuenient
for mee, to recommend theſe ſlender traueiles of
mine, to ſome ſuche ſincere patrons as (I was
ſure) would willinglie vndertake the protection
thereof.</p>
            <p>If now therfore you demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what ſhould moue
mee (among many others) to make ſpecial choiſe
of your ſelues: thinke not (I pray you) but that I
haue reaſon ſufficient to lead mee vnto it. For
firſt, I aſſuredly know you are able to iudge of the
matter. Both becauſe you profeſſe the faculty of
bying and ſelling your ſelues: and for that you are
alſo thoſe good <hi>Marchants</hi> in deed, who (for the
pretious Perle of the Goſpell) can bee content to
forgo whatſoeuer you haue, wherupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that you are the better able to ballance all
the afternamed abuſes, by the eſtimation therof.
Secondly, for that, (by reaſon of our auncient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance)
I haue bin more ſpecially beholding,
to you both, then to anie other beſides: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(although I am detter to all in Chriſt) more
<pb facs="tcp:11342:5"/>
ſpeciallie abound to you both, then to manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beſides.</p>
            <p>Being therfore ſo ſtrongly confirmed herein,
it makes mee the bolder ſpeciallie to preſent you
both, and generallie in you the whole companie
there, with this my poore <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> Moſt humblie
beſeeching you to accept thereof, as a ſpeciall
meanes to renew that our old and ancient loue.
Which loue of ours, being both begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in Chriſt, and for Chriſt: maye bee one

            <p>So ſurelie, my ſelfe (on a ſabboth daye) preaching

ouerſpred vvith the contagious infection of

<pb facs="tcp:11342:6"/>
the ſincere religion of Chriſt, vvhich (by meanes of thoſe
beaſtlie abuſes) began novv (in a maner) to be generallie
deſpiſed, as a religion tending onelie to a verie licencious
and carnall libertie. But as <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the reſt of
that couetous crevv (hovvſoeuer they pretended the
publike ſtate &amp; religion) vvold neuer haue ſo vvinched
at the preaching of Paul, if ſo be their vnlavvful commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
themſelues had not (by circumſtance thereof) bin

Hovvbeit, I (for mine ovvne part) doo not yet
certeinelie knovv the cheefe cauſe in deed of this their

not certeinelie ſet dovvne the ſame. For, vvhether it
vvas becauſe (in their ovvn conſciences) they felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

fullie ſuffice, both to diſplay their deuiſes, and to make

deceiued my ſelfe. Neither could I at anie hand finde

            <p>The principall cauſe vvhich draue me to diſpoſe the

both vvhat they vvere able to ſay for themſelues: &amp; to

            <p>The ſpeakers produced in this preſent treatiſe are
principallie foure, preſenting vnto thee foure ſeuerall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates

ſort of buiers and ſellers. <hi>No-bodie</hi> stands for the

puts vpon him the perſon of the comminaltie. Novv
becauſe the beſt preachers of all are (in theſe daies) not
onelie of no account vvith the vvicked, but oft times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
vniuſtlie accuſed of all men: I haue therefore thus

Moreouer, becauſe thoſe particular reprehenſions
vvhich the godlie preachers (vppon iuſt occaſion) doe

               <p>As though that<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 3. 6.</note> God

               <p>Yea, that was in priuate talk,

               <p>Yea, but it may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
be probablie coniectuted that
this was done only before the Phariſes
and Saduces themſelues, and not in the
preſence of the other people: which if it
be true, then, although the ſame were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
in him, yet haue you nothing
herein for the proofe of your purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Howe little gaine ſoeuer
I haue gotten by this: euery childe may
eſpie your wante of waightier matter,
when onely vpon a bare ſuppoſition, you
are driuen to conclude your purpoſe.
Whereby alſo you haue, at vnawares in
the foreſaid example, directly graunted
againſt your ſelf, that this kinde of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
is tollerable among ſuch as hee
wicked, ſo the ſame be practized onely in
the preſence of thoſe that be acquainted
with the ſelfe-ſame wickednes. But if
you looke well to the matter, you may
finde this thing to be done, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Phariſes and Saduces, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
with the reſt of that viperous
<pb facs="tcp:11342:19"/>
broode: but alſo euen in the preſence of
the other people. For in the fift verſe it
is ſaid that<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 3. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>then went out vnto him, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
and all Iudea, and all the region

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ingroſer</speaker>
               <p>All this may be graunted,
and yet you are neuer the neerer your
purpoſe. For in the verſe next following
it is ſaid, that<note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 3. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>manie of the Phariſes alſo
and Saduces came vnto him.</hi> But when
came they vnto him? euen after he had
preached repentaunce and baptized the
people. So then, it is verie likelie, that
(after he had diſpatched the people and
ſent them packing away) then came alſo
the Phariſes and Saduces vnto him to
learne their leſſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>This your looſe opinion
(which leaneth onely vpon likelihoods)
is more likely to fall to the ground, then
to finde anie firme foundation in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Iohn.</hi> For it is ſaid there, they
came not onely vnto him, but that they
came alſo vnto his Baptiſme, where vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it foloweth, that they alſo were made
partakers of that his <hi>Sermon,</hi> which he
preached vnto the people or euer he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb facs="tcp:11342:19"/>
them. For otherwiſe it had bin an
apiſh imitation in them, to haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
the people in comming to his
baptiſme, hauing heard before no reaſon
at all to leade them vnto it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eueri-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>Why then doth the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts
ſo preciſelie expreſſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of them to the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
immediatlie after the baptizing of the
people, if ſo be they were preſent before?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>This was purpoſely done
to expreſſe the great admiration of <hi>Iohn
Baptiſt</hi> in beholding the ſame. And thus
much alſo the diſcretiue <hi>(autem,</hi> or <hi>but)</hi>
importeth, ſaying<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 3. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>But when hee ſawe
many of the Phariſees and Saduces come to
his baptiſme, he ſaid vnto them: Oh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of vipers, who hath fore-warned you
to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> As if (with
a wonderful admiration) he had ſaide to
himſelfe: and is it poſſible that theſe
men (among the reſt of the people) ſhold
ſo ſuddenly repent from the bottome of
their hearts? Vppon conſideration alſo
wherof he crieth out vnto them ſaying:
Who hath fore-warned you to flee from
the wrath to come? whence ſpringeth
this ſo ſudden an alteration of your
<pb facs="tcp:11342:20"/>
mind? with what an affection haue you
heard my preching? yea, with what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſpirite come you to this my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſiue:
if it be only in hypocriſie of hart, I
tell you in truth, it will nothing auaile
you, but if it be with vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
then looke in any wiſe, that you
witneſſe the ſame to the worlde, by ſuch
fruits as are worthie the amendment of
life. Thus then you ſee the cauſe whie
the euangeliſt ſo preciſely expreſſeth the
comming of the Phariſes and Saduces
to the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; that alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after the baptizing of the reſt
of the people.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ingroſer.</speaker>
               <p>If he dealt, as you ſay, thus
roundly with the Phariſees &amp; Saduces,
&amp; that alſo in the preſence of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
with what affection, I pray you, was
he mooued ſo bitterly to inueigh againſt
thoſe men alone, &amp; to ſpare the reſt of the
people. Surelie the one of theſe two (me
thinke) muſt neceſſarilie followe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
namely, that either the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were departed before, or otherwiſe
in ſpeaking ſo plainely to the Phariſes
and Saduces alone the people ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that they onlie, and not anie of the
<pb facs="tcp:11342:20"/>
other people were guiltie of ſinne.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>Neither of both. For firſt,
that the people alſo were ſinners aſwell
as the other, it is very apparant by their
comming to baptiſme: otherwiſe the
ſame had beene needles vnto them. For
baptiſme was a Sacrament of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
away of their ſins. And ſecondlie,
that the people alſo were preſent at this
the reprehenſion of the Phariſees and
Saduces, it hath beene prooued before.
Nowe with what affection <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>
was mooued to ſpeake eſpeciallie to
them in the preſence of all the reſt: it is
to be conſidered, that this his publike
proceeding againſt the Phariſees and
Saduces, was principaly done in regard
of the whole church of God. Who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
on the one ſide, the wickedneſſe of
thoſe whome they tooke for their guides
ſo openlie reuealed: and perceiuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
on the other ſide, that euen they
alſo which<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 23. 27.</note> outwardlie pretended a
glittering ſhewe of godlineſſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie
but rotten bones, they might
themſelues be ſtricken with a greater
terrour of the iudgements of God: and
therevpon (being thus driuen to a deeper
<pb facs="tcp:11342:21"/>
conſideration of their curſed eſtate) they
woulde the more eaſily be wonne to an
vnfained repentaunce of their former
wickedneſſe. Which generall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
the apoſtle alſo himſelfe doeth will
vs to wait, for from ſuch publike repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
ſaying,<note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 20.</note>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ingroſer.</speaker>
               <p>If the reſt of the people
(as your ſelfe haue affirmed) were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
as wel as thoſe Phariſees and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
of whome wee haue ſpoken: what
moued him then ſo bitterly to bende his
force onelie againſt theſe, and let the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eſcape? This ſauoreth very muche

ſcot-free, although I affirme that
he dealt more roundlie wyth theſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
and Saduces than wyth the reſt
of the people. And yet if you liſt to read
the third chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> you ſhal finde
<note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 3. 7. 10, 11 12 13 14</note> there, the ſelfe-ſame reprehenſions

               <p>Although I cannot denie

               <p>Very true as you ſay. And
becauſe that contraries do more timelie
appeare by their contraries: I thinke
it expedient (for the better performance

one hower without the naturall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
of naturall thinges: So hath the
Lorde alſo in wiſedome ordeined this law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
trade of buying and ſelling, as a moſte
neceſſarie meanes to maintaine the ſame.
And as hee hath againe in<note n="a" place="margin">Guil. pariſſ. in lib. de vitiis par. 4.</note> his owne
councell determined, that no one countrey
<pb facs="tcp:11342:26"/>

               <p>The ſecond kinde of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundrie
is called <hi>Deuertio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. The ſecond kinde of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandrie.</note> which is a
truſtie tranſporting of wares (from thoſe
portes and hauens which were fraughted
before by the aforeſaide nauigation) into
all the other partes and quarters of the
realme, for the ſpeedier ſupplie of ſo manie
beſides as want the ſame. And vnder this
ſecond kinde of Merchandrie alſo are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
two ſortes of traffikes: For, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are thoſe chapmen (whether tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers
<pb facs="tcp:11342:29"/>
abroad in the country, or ingroſers,
and retalers dwelling in Citties) which
from time to time do vnlade and diſburden
the lately ariued nauy of their wares what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer:
and laying them vp in their vauts
and ſtorehouſes) doe ſo ſell the ſame, and
vtter them foorth vnto others, as they ſee
they haue neede: or elſe they are thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
whereſoeuer, which doe bring their
commodities (newly gained) to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
handes: as doe the Glouers to the
Staplers, the Clothiers to the Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and ſuch like. Thus ſeeking by their
daily endeuour, and painefull trauels, to
fraught the lately vnladed nauie afreſh, and
to further the ſame in her future voyages,
for the ſpeedier accompliſhement of bothe
the aboue named ends. Now the ouerſight
and care for the execution hereof (reaching
it ſelfe generally to all) more properlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
not onely to Politikes,<note place="margin">Philoſophus.</note> I meane the
Magiſtrates of euery citie and ſhire,<note place="margin">1. Ethico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> who
are to ſee a generall prouiſion made for the
whole bodie and ſtate of their countrie, but
alſo in more ſpeciall maner to houſholders,
whoſe whole endeuour muſt principally be

ſea or by land, are woorthtlie alſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Merchaunts. Such were<note n="b" place="margin">Geneſ. 37. 28</note> thoſe

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ingroſer.</speaker>
               <p>You haue ſpoken alreadie of
two kindes of merchandrie: the firſt named
<hi>Nauigatio,</hi> appertaining (you ſay) vnto
Merchants of the Staple, and Merchant
aduenturers. The ſecond called <hi>Deuectio,</hi>
whoſe practiſe concerneth eſpeciallie the
Ingroſers, Trauellers, and country Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb facs="tcp:11342:30"/>
although the care for the execution
thereof more properly beſeemeth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of cities and Maiſters of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
But I pray you (ſir) to what kinde
of Merchaundrie will you aſcribe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
or trade which the Haberdaſhers,
Mercers, Pedlers, and ſuch other do prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>Verely euen vnto that third
kinde of Merchandrie,<note place="margin">The third kinde of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandrie.</note> as yet remaining
vntouched, <hi>viz. Negotiatio,</hi> that is to ſaie,
a ſaleable exchange of temporall thinges,
practized onelie by ſuche as do make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
thereof for filthie gaine: whiche
may fitlie bee called a chopping or chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.
And of this third kinde of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandrie
alſo are ſundrie ſorts of chopmen.
For eyther they are thoſe Haberdaſhers
Mercers, Pedlers, and ſuche like, which,
buying of one doe ſell to an other: or elſe
they are thoſe occupiers, graſiers, traun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and others, who carieng from any part
of the realme ſuch cattell, corne, and other
commodities as groweth there, into ſome
other part &amp; place of the relme, or, who buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leane Oxen, Sheep, and other cattel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the countrie, do fat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in paſturs,
&amp; ſo ſel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foorth for their beſt aduantage.
<pb facs="tcp:11342:31"/>
Now theſe two ſortes of traffikers (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
diuers ſortes of chapmen) are all
comprehended vnder that third kinde of
merchandrie called <hi>Negotiatio,</hi> and maye
very fitlie be termed chappers and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
And whereas the trade of theſe men,
ſhoulde eſpecially bee employed towardes
the preſeruation of thoſe poore people
which are otherways vnable to make their
prouiſion themſelues, wee ſee the ſame to
be of al other the moſt beaſtlie abuſed. And
therefore this was that kinde of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie,
againſt the abuſes whereof I ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
did bend my purpoſe this day.</p>

               <p>What fault ſir, I pray you, is
to be founde therewith, ſeeing you confes
the ſame to be a kinde of merchandrie: and
merchandrie, you ſayd but euen nowe, is ſo

moſt iuſtlie reprooued, becauſe gayne is

doe both blaſpheme the Lorde for

doe ſell foorth vnto others theyr

               <p>It is verye true. For as
ſome thinges are flatlie forbydden, not by

they bee alſo euill in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
namely, addulterie, murther, theft,

breache of the lawe of GOD: So there
are ſome thynges agayne, which be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydden,
onelie (as it were) by occaſion,
not becauſe they are euill of them ſelues,
but for that (by reaſon of theyr manifolde
abuſes) great euils oft tymes doe enſue
the practize of them, as wyne, meate, fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
water and ſuch lyke. Which things
(albeit in their proper nature) they are
moſt neceſſarie and commodious for man:
yet oftentimes we ſee (euen in a miſerable
experience) that (by their abuſe) they are
turned to his deſtruction. In the ſelfe
ſame condition conſiſteth this your facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of buyinge and ſellinge. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(in the owne nature) the ſame bee
not euill: Yet notwithſtanding it maie

               <p>Thys then I ſuppoſe

               <p>It is euen the ſame.
For as wyne, meate, fyer, water and

               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>That may eaſily be doone.
For notwithſtanding, the wares be neither

by decetfully ſelling ſome one for another,
yet the abuſes this way conſidered, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:11342:43"/>
be wrought in a double reſpect: namely,
either by pretending that quality of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to be in the wares which properly they
haue not: or otherwaies by couering and
hiding thoſe euils which they haue.</p>
            </sp>

a better togither,<note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 20. 12. 13. 14. &amp;c. Iſay. 29. 15. 16. 17.</note> that ſo (the baſenes
of the bad more brauely ſetting foorth the

made more deſirous therof. Which dealing
of theirs (how delightfull ſo euer) differeth
vndoubtedly, nothing at all from the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of an vnſatiable Strumpet or whore:
who prancketh her necke, and painteth her

ſhops, &amp; cloſe houſes of ſet purpoſe, to blind
the blemiſhes of their wares, &amp; to darken
thoſe their deformities, which otherwiſe
would be apparant to al men: or when (the
defects and faultes of their wares beeing
not outwardly apparant to others, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie
knowne to themſelues) they doe
verie wickedlie conceale them, and will
in no wiſe bee brought to diſcouer the

            <sp>
               <speaker>No-body.</speaker>
               <p>Yea no doubt. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, for that euerie man ought to be no
leſſe carefull of another mans commoditie
than of his owne. Wherevnto alſo, euen
the verie inſtitution of nature, and light
of reaſon doe leade vs. For nature (wee
ſee) dooth ſhewe her ſelfe euerie waie as
carefull in conſeruing the meaneſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as the mighteſt of all. And reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
requireth, that nothing be doone guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
deceitfully, nor fraudulently among
men, according to that which the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:11342:44"/>
commaundeth, ſaying: Let no manne op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
nor defraude his brother in bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(or in any maner of thing) for the Lord
is the auenger of all ſuch euill. So then,
thoſe falſe men (you ſee) do not only dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
from nature her ſelfe, but do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declare themſelues to be verie vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
beaſts, who ſeeke thus to ſhrowd

of thoſe their wares, which they dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
for good to their brethren in bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pedler.</speaker>
               <p>A proper deuiſe forſooth: but
followe it who luſt. For howe ſhall we be
ſure to ſell? Or who will be haſtie in bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
our wares when the faults therof are
apparantly knowne?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-body.</speaker>
               <p>As though the diſcouerie of
their faults woulde be anie hinderance at
all to a conſcionable ſale of your wares: or
as though thoſe faultie wares (beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for one purpoſe) may not fitlie be made
to ſerue for another. If therefore you chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
woulde firſt enquire of the buier, for
what purpoſe he buieth, ſhoulde you not
eaſilie perceiue (by the anſwere he giueth)
whether thoſe your ſaide wares will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſerue him, or not? Nowe if by his
<pb facs="tcp:11342:45"/>
anſwere you finde them vnfit, then looke
in gods name, that you lay them aſide, and
either prouide him of better, or otherwiſe
do tel him you haue not to ſerue his turne.
But if you perceiue that his wares (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng
their imperfections) maye
as fitlye ſerue for his purpoſe, as if they
were better: then, hauing firſt acquainted
the buier with their faults whatſoeuer, do
aſſure him in all ſimplicitie, that the ſame,
notwithſtanding their wants wil both fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerue his turne, and that you alſo your
ſelfe may affoorde it vnto him of an eaſier
reckoning. Surely this conſcionable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
howe hardlie ſoeuer it ſeemeth now,
being but practiſed a while, would in the
end procure you ſuch credit, that whereas
the other (who deale but deceitfully) doe
purchaſe a pennie, you your ſelfe ſhall bee
ſure to purchaſe a pounde. Beſides that,
as the buier, by this meanes, ſhall not be
diſappointed of that his principal purpoſe,
nor at no hande bee deceiued wyth thoſe
faultie wares. So neither ſhall the ſeller
himſelfe incurre the diſpleaſure of GOD,
by encreaſing his wealth with deceitfull
gaine.</p>

men of <hi>Tyrus</hi> alſo therin, which brought fiſhe

the Children of <hi>Iudah</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Then
reprooued I the rulers of <hi>Iudah</hi> and ſaid vnto

commaunded to ſhut the gates, and charged
that they ſhould not be opened til after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth.

Iuſtice to be proportionably obſerued of
all men in their buying and ſelling. Now
for that<note n="c" place="margin">Ezech. 18. 4. 10 Rom. 6. 23.</note> the Iuſtice of God diſpenceth
with no ſinne be it neuer ſo little, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that we (in kéeping this equalitie of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice)
muſt euer doo vnto others, as we

no man him ſelfe would willingly be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

And therefore, it behoueth him alſo to
meaſure the price vnto others, in a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe

Thus then (you ſée) that if we be rightly
carefull (in déed) to ſhun the ſaide Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God we maye in no wiſe, take
twelue pence for ſixe pence. For why
ſhould not the others twelue pence in mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye

that if (in the exchange of theſe
temporall commodities) the one party be
founde to haue more then the other: he
which hath the more ſhould willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
(for a recompence) as muche of his

            <sp>

               <p>Euen the ſame which hath
euermore an eſpeciall regard vnto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.
As for example, Fiue is the meane
(you knowe) between fower and ſix: the
which euen by adding vnto it but one)
both excéedeth, and is alſo excéeded it ſelf.
If therfore (either of the parties hauing
only fiue at the firſt,) the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
take but euen one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other: this man
that ſo taketh, ſhould haue ſixe to himſelf

of God (according to Arithmaticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion)
requireth for the better redreſſe
héerof) that either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both he brought
againe to the meane, which is fiue.
And this may eaſily be doone, by taking
one from him that hath ſix, to giue it the
other who hath but foure, and ſo either

is the meane betwéene foure and ſixe, as

               <p>I ſay not ſo. For as I affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

maye lawfullye take a reaſonable
gaine in the ſale of his wares.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eueri-bodye.</speaker>
               <p>What conſiderations
are thoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>Verilye, euen ſuch as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerne the ſeller himſelfe, and partly
alſo the wares which are ſolde. For firſt,
concerning the ſeller him ſelfe, a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gaine is alowed vnto him: when firſt
his trauel in buying and ſelling dooth tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
tend to a publike commoditie, and not
to a priuate aduauntage. Secondly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as by his owne endeuour, thoſe wares
which he bought before are any thinge
bettered, either by adding vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
thing which they wanted: or otherwaies
by a chargeable preſeruing of them in
their proper goodnes. And thirdly, when
as he hath béene at charges by tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:11342:66"/>
his ſaide wares from place to place.
Now next, concerning the wares which
are to be ſolde. Séeing one certaine, one
iuſt and vnchangeable price thereof hath
not hitherto béene determined, neither
poſſible can be: becauſe thoſe wares muſt
ſometimes be eſteemed in their naturall
propertie, and ſo Muſke (for that it quick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth
the ſprites and maketh them liuely
is more pretious then Golde. Somtimes
alſo they are to be valewed according to
their rarity and ſcarſeneſſe: and ſo golde
ſurmounteth in valure any graine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.
And ſometime againe according
to thoſe ſeaſons wherein they are ſolde:
being otherwhiles cheaper: otherwhiles
dearer. Now, becauſe in euerye of theſe
and ſuch other accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the very intereſt
it ſelfe doothe ſtande vpon hazarde: who
would not allow thoſe Merchants ſome
reaſonable gaine in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſale of their wares,
eſpeciallye, when they ſtick not to adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their priuate commodities for the
publike profite of all men. Moreouer, for
that (if after the firſte buying of wares,
their prices abate, the Merchant which
ſo buyes them is ſure him ſelfe to abide
by the loſſe: me thinnk (on the other ſide)
<pb facs="tcp:11342:66"/>
its very reaſonable, that if after the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them their prices encreaſe, he alſo
him ſelfe ſhould likewiſe receiue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite.
And therfore I conclude, that for
theſe and ſuch other like neceſſarye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideracions,
euery chapman in the ſale of
his wares, may lawfully take a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gaine. For as<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 7.</note> no man goeth euer
a warfare at his proper charges: ſo ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 10. 10. 1. Tim. 5. 18.</note> the woorkman is alwaies woorthy
of his reward whatſoeuer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eueri-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>And who (I praye you)
muſt be the iudge to determine this their
reaſonable allowance? For, ſeeing neither
their expences nor yet the price of their
wares, can (as you ſay) be poſſibly known
to any ſaue only themſelues, and a fewe
beſides of their trade: me thinke it were
hard for any to ſeeke a certaintye thereof
at themſelues alone, as alſo to enquire
out the ſame at the hands of thoſe other,
that were but to aſke my fellow if I be a
théefe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>True it is. And therefore
may ſelfe loue, at no hande determine the
matter: but men muſt be directed therin
by the teſtimonye of a Chriſtian conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as I tolde you before.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>When conſcience (hauing
firſt driuen the commodities giuen and
receiued as néere to equalitie as poſſible
may be) dooth then ſet downe ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differente

contented to giue to another: and this is
the onlye and the beſt direction I knowe.
For ſéeing both their trauels and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
be vnknowne (as you ſaye) and the
iuſt prices alſo of their wares are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
ſet downe, but muſt from time to

can poſſiblie be kept in ſuch intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

dooth not ſtrike the ſtroke. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Let thrée ſeuerall men of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfeſame
trade (taking all a like viewe of one and

to ſet downe their ſeuerall determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning the certaine price therof:
and you ſhall ſée how much they will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
therin, which argueth how difficult a

diſcharge of theſe matters, according to
<pb facs="tcp:11342:67"/>

                  <pb facs="tcp:11342:77"/>
companie (as you haue heard) but do very
couertly alſo procure a more generall
hurt to that common wealth whereof
they are members, and this alſo by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and ſundrie meanes. As firſt, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poueriſhing
the greater parte thereof,
through ſome péeuiſhe purpoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themſelues and their offſpring. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in procuring a dearth by little
and little to ſteale on the land, through
that their exceſſiue hoording vp and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the good bleſſings therein. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the vtter vndooing of many poore
men, through their falſe and fraudulent
dealings. Fourthly, by compelling great
numbers of people to begge or to ſteale,
and ſo conſequently, either to ſtarue in
the ſtreetes, or otherwaies, to be cut off
by vntimely deathes. All which (with
ſundry other moſt fearefull effectes) can
not chooſe but kindle ſome further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,

confuſion, except the ſame be more
ſpéedely preuented. For, firſt it can not
but foſter a ſecret grudge in the minds of
the rich men one with another: which is
(in very deede) the mother of all muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and ciuill diſſentions. Secondly, it
<pb facs="tcp:11342:78"/>
hardneth the harts of the poore againſt
the wealthie, and makes them (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
ſo deſperate, they care not a dodkin
which ende goeth forward. Thirdly, it
weakeneth verie ſhrewdly the whole
land it ſelfe by little and little: and ſo
conſequently encourageth ſome one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
enimie or other to giue the onſet
vpon it.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11342:78"/>
thoſe gréedie ſpoilers themſelues, which
ſo gréedely had ſpoyled many thouſands
before. And for further proof of this point,
I will at this preſent content my ſelfe
with one Propheſie of <hi>Amos</hi> againſt the
rich Cormorants and Cutthroates of
that his age: who forbore neither time
nor place, but (with falſe meaſures and
waights) bought &amp; ſold the poore people
for ſhoes, ſaying:<note n="a" place="margin">Amos. 8. 5. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>When will the new
moneth be gone, that we may ſell corne? and
the Sabboth, that we may ſet foorth wheate,
and make the Ephah ſmall and the Shekell
great, and falſifie the waights by deceite? that
we may buye the poore for ſiluer, and the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
for ſhoes: yea, and ſell the refuſe of wheat?
The Lord hath ſworne by the excellencie of
<hi>Iaacob,</hi> ſurely, I will neuer forget any of
their works.</hi> Shall not the Land tremble
for this, and euery one mourne that
dwelleth therein? And it ſhall riſe vp
wholly as a floud, and it ſhall be caſt out
and drowned, as by the floud of Egipt.
<hi>And in that day</hi> (ſayth the Lord) <hi>I will
euen cauſe the Sunne to goe downe at noone:
and I will darken the earth in the cleere day.
And I will turne your feaſtes into mourning,
and all your ſongs into lamentation: and I wil
<pb facs="tcp:11342:79"/>
bring ſackcloth vpon all loynes, and baldneſſe
vpon euery head: and I will make it as the
mourning of an onely ſonne, and the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as a bitter day. Behold, the day is come</hi>
(ſayth the Lord) <hi>that I will ſend a famine
in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt
for water, but of hearing the word of the
Lord: and they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea,
and from the North euen vnto the Eaſt ſhall
they runne too and fro, to ſeeke the Word of
the Lord, and ſhall not finde it. And in that
day, ſhall the faire virgins and yong men periſh
for thirſt.</hi> Loe, héere you may ſee their
ſinne of crueltie, and fraudulent dealing
decyphered fully, together with the
fearefull effects which folow the ſame,
namely, a common calamitie of the
whole countrey or land concerning both
bodée and ſoule. And thus much briefelie

the ſellers diſordered dealings are
not onely diſcerned of all men, but, euen
his whole bodie alſo it ſelfe, and euerie
member thereof is very fitly derided, and
moſt iuſtly deteſted as a moſt filthy and
loathſome carryon. Namely, when his
head is accompted with all men, the very
Cage of deceites: when his eyes are no
better eſtéemed, then the very Scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches
of wickednes: when his eares
are abhorred, as the Ewes-droppers of

diſtruſted then the poyſon of Aſpis: when
<pb facs="tcp:11342:81"/>
his handes and euery finger thereof are
hated like the limetwigs of a lurching
Cormorant: when his féete are eſchued
as the craftie ſupporters of a pilfering

walke vp and downe in the ſtréetes) for
thoſe, who ſeeke to beguile and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
no moe then haue any dealinges
with them at all. And in this reſpect,
thoſe ſellers them ſelues may fitly bée
compared to a Snayle, which neuer kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
(in creeping about) any ordinarie
courſe, but with windings and turnings
conuayeth her ſelfe into her Cottage: ſo
ſurely, ſuch ſellers as ſéeke onely for

chriſtian courſe in thoſe their common
affaires, but ſéeke by windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to conuay themſelues into the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

ſubtill deuiſes, in concealing the mind by

drawne from that dutifull obedience
which Chriſtians are to declare therein

principally handle in theſe words, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

that practize the trade of buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
you eſpecially it behoueth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that when you come to bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
you are not to reſpect your priuate
commodities, but rather, to way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that in this your bargaining you
come as it were to witneſſe your duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

That is, to teſtifie firſt of all what faith

in ſhewing foorth your chriſtian

with whome you haue to deale.
Now, this your ſaid loue towards them
can not any wayes more effectually be
found, then in that plaine and vpright
dealing, which the lawe of the Lord in a
dutifull obedience, doth exact at your
hands. But (alas for pitie) who ſo doth

moſt ſurely and moſt ſharply ſcourge the

ſignifie as much in effect, as thoſe euils
themſelues whereunto they haue ſuch

which the Lord in iuſtice alotteth

hath he héere aſſigned no one certaine
kinde of puniſhment vnto it. Teaching
men thereby, that as the Lord is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to plague, when, where, and in
what manner he pleaſe: ſo you Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould tremble and quake at euerie
puniſhment, as at a iuſt recompence of
ſuch your ſiniſter dealings, according to
that which the Lord himſelfe doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
ſaying.<note n="a" place="margin">Mich. 6. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Are yet the treaſures of
wickedneſſe in the houſe of the wicked, and
the ſcant meaſure that is abhominable? Shall
I iuſtifie the wicked Ballances, and the Bagge
of deceitfull waightes? For, the rich men of
Ieruſalem are full of crueltie, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereof haue ſpoken lyes, and their toong
is deceitfull in their mouthes. Therefore alſo
will I make thee ſicke in ſmiting thee, and in
making thee deſolate, becauſe of thy ſinnes.
Thou ſhalt eate, and not be ſatisfied, and thy
<pb facs="tcp:11342:91"/>
caſting downe ſhall be in the middeſt of thee,
and thou ſhalt take holde, but ſhalt not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
and that which thou deliuereſt, will I
giue vp to the ſword. Thou ſhalt ſowe, but not
reape, thou ſhalt treade the Oliues, but not
annoynt thee with Oyle, and make ſweete
Wine, but ſhalt not drinke Wine.</hi> In theſe
words, the Lord (you ſée) both repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the enormities and ſinnes of ſuch
fraudulent dealers, and alſo denounceth
againſt them, not one, but ſundrie kinds
of puniſhments due for the fame. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
an vtter conſumption and waſting by
famine, by inward greefes and ſorowes,
by making fruſtrate their hope of helpe,
by ſpoiling their goods within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
Séeing therefore the Lord hath not
aſſigned any one ſpeciall plague vnto ſuch
their ſubtill and ſiniſter dealings, but
maketh the ſame ſubiect to ſo many ſorts
of puniſhments: this (me thinke) ſhould
be a ſufficient reaſon to remoue farre off
from Chapmen, all fraudulent fetches in
buying and ſelling. For that, as the Lord
will ſurely be auenged of all ſuch things,
ſo hath he made this ſinne ſubiect (you
ſée) to euerie puniſhment. Wherein men
are to remember, that not onely euerie
<pb facs="tcp:11342:92"/>
ſinne hath ſome puniſhment attending

               <p>Oh graunt it good Lorde, for
the glorie of thy name. But Sir? ſuch is
the vnreaſonable enhaunſing of graine

               <p>Verie true it is. If therefore
you could (by any your godly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions)
ſo bring it to paſſe, that the rich
Farmers and Huſbandmen (who are to

you, that, as thereby I ſhould haue

            <sp>
               <speaker>No-bodie.</speaker>
               <p>I haue none authoritie (you
knowe) to reforme things amiſſe: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I challenge ſo much to my
ſelfe. My duetie is onely to reproue, and
to denounce the iudgements of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all outragious enormities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(by Gods grace) I will not ceaſe to
doo my beſt endeuour, leauing the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of matters whollie vnto them,
whoſe callings the ſame more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
concernes. But, what if thoſe men
(you ſpake of before) will neuer bee
brought to any better dealings? ſhall
the waywardneſſe of thoſe wicked ones
withdrawe your ſelues from dooing
your duties? Oh beware (I beſéeche
you) for this is the ſubtill perſwaſion of
Satan, to make you beleeue, that you
may as well offend therein, as another.
<pb facs="tcp:11342:94"/>
But, remember the word of the Lord,

               <p>Nay (by Gods grace) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer

But Sir? if it might pleaſe you to take

               <p>Well, ſith you ſéeke this

But we beſéeche you (Sir) linger not

<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 69. 9.</note> Gods houſe hath euen eaten vs

that the<note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 13. 12.</note> hope whiche is defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

Walke you on your way all thrée to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

               <p>But ſo are not we. Nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
